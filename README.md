## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JC, and I am a student at Brown University double concentrating in Computer Science and Biology. I am interested in all things related to web development and systems. I have a passion for building user-centered applications and exploring how systems programming and architecture can enhance software performance. I also enjoy combining my background as a D1 track and field athlete (long jumper/sprinter) with tech to create innovative solutions in the sports and rehab space.
